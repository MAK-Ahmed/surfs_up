## Overview
The purpose of the analysis was to review the temperatures in the month of June and December and get Summary statistics. The analysis is to identify where it would be best to open an ice cream shop on the island of Oahu. Understanding what the average temperature is in June versus what the average temperature is in December can help identify if the location is ideal for the year.
## Results
The results in the analysis are looking across a 7 year time period in the month of June and December.

* June had an Average temperature of 75 degrees F and December had an average of 71 Fahrenheit.
*	While the average temp and max temp between the two months are fairly similar, it is worthwhile to note that the min temp in December is 56 which is significantly lower than the min temp in June. 
*	Finally, there are more datapoints available in the month of June versus the month of December 1700 and 1517 data points respectively, and that the data points are more spread-out in December versus June.



## Summary
The summary data from the two tables above can provide a quick overview of the trends within the past 7 years for the two months, but a visual representation of the data may be more ideal in comparing the two months. 

### Additional Queries
Two additional queries that I can perform to get more weather data is to look at the precipitation and temp during both of these months and compare them. As noted in the tables below, there are less datapoints for precipitation than temp for both months. The minimum precipitation for both months is 0 while the max is 4.43 and 6.42 for June and December respectively.
As Hawaii is an island, It would be interesting to note if there were any natural disasters during these two months as well over the past 7 years, and how it impacted the precipitation and the temperature.
